classes are basically templates 
object is a instance of a class
static meathod / static attribute 

static methods can not access objects level members, must create object

do and while loop are postface?

| boolean logical inclusive OR
^ boolean logical exclosive OR
& boolean logical and
&& and || or ! not

method overload only happens in the same class

array list can only hold primiative types

DO NOT USE ARRAY . SORT :(

subclass inherts all of the attributes and methods but no constructor 

only methods have polomorphism 

poloymorphims allows the programmer to program in general rather than program in specific

cant use abstract class to create objects 

public abstract void draw(); //abstract method 

methods defined in the interface at default are public 

try {} catch {} finally {}
try does not need to have catch 
if you use exit statement the finally block will not be exectuted 

we have to take care of all errors that are not runtime exceptions 
untracked exceptions 

catch or throw exceptions 
methodA() throws SQLExceptions { statement 1; } 
methodB() throws Exception { methodA(); } 

can have multiple exceptions but must have superclass "eception" after subclass "exception A / exception B"

public > protected > default > private 
biggest to smallest
